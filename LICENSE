Non-Compete
For projects utilizing Bubba’s Berserks and Bosses ideas, code, or assets, direct competition with the original mod is not permitted. A project is considered in competition with Bubba’s Berserks and Bosses if it offers to players gameplay features or interactive content from Bubba’s Berserks and Bosses on the Minecraft Java Edition platform. Modpacks are exempt from this clause so long as they contain sufficiently large amounts of content to warrant the redistribution of Bubba’s Berserks and Bosses files for ease of installation.
